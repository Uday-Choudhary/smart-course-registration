## Smart Course Registration System

A dynamic, university-level course registration platform for students, faculty, and admins to manage courses efficiently and stress-free! Go beyond basic enrollment with smart suggestions, automatic conflict detection, and insightful analytics.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Section Courses**  
  Register for different sections (like CS101-A, CS101-B), each with its own schedule, instructor, and classroom.

- **Seat Limits & Waitlists**  
  Sections have defined seat limits. When full, students automatically join a waitlist. Background automation promotes waitlisted students as soon as seats open up.

- **Timetable Clash Detection**  
  No more accidental clashes! The system uses hard (same time) and soft (back-to-back) rules to prevent overlapping schedules.

- **Smart Suggestions**  
  If a clash occurs, the system instantly proposes alternate sections or generates a custom, optimized schedule based on preferences like avoiding early mornings and long gaps.

- **Add/Drop Functionality**  
  Add or drop courses with live updates to seats and waitlists, all within defined registration windows.

- **Notifications**  
  Get instant alerts for waitlist movement, reminders before deadlines, and every key registration update.

- **Analytics & Reports**  
  Track seat usage, monitor waitlist trends, view registration statistics, and easily export data for admin and faculty use.
